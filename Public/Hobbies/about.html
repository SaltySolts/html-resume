<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
  <h3>Welcome!</h3> 
  
  <p>My name is Sabrina Ochoa - I'm 27 years old and am making a career change from working in the tech reselling business to web development and beyond. I love learning and adapting. 
  Coding has been a fun and rewarding challenge for me and am always working on honing my skills to be better. 
  </p>

  <p>I'm fueled by my passion to create a beautiful but useful product and I pride myself on my work and give my all to any project I work on.
  I'm a full-stack, frontend & backend developer and am planning on doing and learning more.
  If you take an interest in any of my work or have questions, please feel free to send me an email (SOchoa.WD@gmail.com). 
  I would love to hear from you!
  </p>

  <p>Other than web development, on my free time, I love to hang out with my husband and our cat Liam. 
  We play a ton of computer games and like to visit our local coffee shops and restaurants. And of course, we also love visiting our family and friends.</p>
  
  <p>I'm also a big movie nerd, love music and love to watch one or two (okay... maybe more) YouTube videos and get inspired to try something new.
    Getting to try something I've never done before, just for the sake of trying it, has always been a motivating factor for me. 
    If you aren't trying something new now, it might be too late to try it later. At least, that's my thought process.

 <p>Please feel free to browse some of my projects and a serious big thank you for visiting my "About Me" page! More projects to come.
